//set_socket_codepoint uses the qwave API to create a register a QOS flow and set the TOS parameter from a preset QOS_TRAFFIC_TYPE
//Parameters:
// socket - the socket object being used
// trafficType - member of the QOS_TRAFFIC_TYPE enum, use QOSTrafficTypeAudioVideo for CS5
// flowId - unique integer value for this flow. Many implementations just use 0
// addr - if the socket is already connected, you may pass `NULL` for `addr`
//        otherwise, the port and address of `addr` must match that in the connect call for the socket
